question: "A company has an AWS account used for software engineering. The AWS account has access to the company’s on-premises data center through a pair of AWS Direct Connect connections.

The development team needs to allow the function to access a database that runs in a private subnet in the company’s data center. Which solution will fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Configure the Lambda function to run in the VPC with the appropriate security group."
  B: "Set up a VPN connection from AWS to the data center. Route the traffic from the Lambda function through the VPN."
  C: "Update the route tables in the VPC to allow the Lambda function to access the on-premises data center through Direct Connect."
  D: "Create an Elastic IP address. Configure the Lambda function to send traffic through the Elastic IP address without an elastic network interface."
