Which solution will deploy the function in the MOST operationally ecient way?"
options:
  A: "Create an Amazon API Gateway REST API. Configure the method to use the Lambda function. Enable IAM authentication on the API."
  B: "Create a Lambda function URL for the function. Specify AWS_IAM as the authentication type."
  C: "Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Deploy the function to Lambda@Edge. Integrate IAM authentication logic into the Lambda@Edge function."
  D: "Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Deploy the function to CloudFront Functions. Specify AWS_IAM as the authentication type."
