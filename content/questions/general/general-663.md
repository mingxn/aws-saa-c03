The company also wants to scale the application automatically when application demand increases. The company will use AWS Elastic Beanstalk for application deployment. Which solution will fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Configure an Elastic Beanstalk environment to use burstable performance instances in unlimited mode. Configure the environment to scale based on requests."
  B: "Configure an Elastic Beanstalk environment to use compute optimized instances. Configure the environment to scale based on requests."
  C: "Configure an Elastic Beanstalk environment to use compute optimized instances. Configure the environment to scale on a schedule."
  D: "Configure an Elastic Beanstalk environment to use burstable performance instances in unlimited mode. Configure the environment to scale on predictive metrics."
