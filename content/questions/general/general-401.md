question: "A company wants to use the AWS Cloud to make an existing application highly available and resilient. The current version of the application resides in the company's data center. The application recently experienced data loss after a database server crashed because of an unexpected power outage. The company needs a solution that avoids any single points of failure. The solution must give the application the ability to scale to fulfill user demand. Which solution will fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Deploy the application servers by using Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. Use an Amazon RDS DB instance in a Multi-AZ conguration."
  B: "Deploy the application servers by using Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group in a single Availability Zone. Deploy the database on an EC2 instance. Enable EC2 Auto Recovery."
  C: "Deploy the application servers by using Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. Use an Amazon RDS DB instance with a read replica in a single Availability Zone. Promote the read replica to replace the primary DB instance if the primary DB instance fails."
  D: "Deploy the application servers by using Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. Deploy the primary and secondary database servers on EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones.
