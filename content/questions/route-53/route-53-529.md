options:
  A: "Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the NLBs. Increase the Cache-Control max-age parameter."
  B: "Replace the NLBs with Application Load Balancers (ALBs). Configure Route 53 to use latency-based routing."
  C: "Add AWS Global Accelerator in front of the NLBs. Configure a Global Accelerator endpoint to use the correct listener ports."
  D: "Add an Amazon API Gateway endpoint behind the NLBs. Enable API caching. Override method caching for the different stages."
