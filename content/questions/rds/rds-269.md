question: "An ecommerce company has noticed performance degradation of its Amazon RDS based web application. The performance degradation is attributed to an increase in the number of read-only SQL queries triggered by business analysts. A solutions architect needs to solve the problem with minimal changes to the existing web application. What should the solutions architect recommend?"
options:
  A: "Export the data to Amazon DynamoDB and have the business analysts run their queries."
  B: "Load the data into Amazon ElastiCache and have the business analysts run their queries."
  C: "Create a read replica of the primary database and have the business analysts run their queries."
  D: "Copy the data into an Amazon Redshift cluster and have the business analysts run their queries."
answer: "C"
explanation: "Creating a read replica is a common approach to offload read-only queries from the primary database, improving overall performance. A read replica is an asynchronous copy of the primary database that allows for read-only operations.  Read replicas can be transparently used by the web application without requiring changes to the application logic. Business analysts can direct their read-only queries to the read replica, reducing the load on the primary database."
