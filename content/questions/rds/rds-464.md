question: "A company hosts an online shopping application that stores all orders in an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL Single-AZ DB instance. Management wants to eliminate single points of failure and has asked a solutions architect to recommend an approach to minimize database downtime without requiring any changes to the application code. Which solution fulfills these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Convert the existing database instance to a Multi-AZ deployment by modifying the database instance and specifying the Multi-AZ option."
  B: "Create a new RDS Multi-AZ deployment. Take a snapshot of the current RDS instance and restore the new Multi-AZ deployment with the snapshot."
  C: "Create a read-only replica of the PostgreSQL database in another Availability Zone. Use Amazon Route 53 weighted record sets to distribute requests across the databases."
  D: "Place the RDS for PostgreSQL database in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with a minimum group size of two. Use Amazon Route 53 weighted record sets to distribute requests across instances."
answer: "A"
explanation: "By converting the existing RDS instance to a Multi-AZ deployment, you enable high availability with automatic failover. Amazon RDS will automatically replicate the database to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). In the event of a failure, Amazon RDS will automatically promote the standby to the primary, minimizing downtime."
