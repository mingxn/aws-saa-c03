question: "A company is using a SQL database to store movie data that is publicly accessible. The database runs on an Amazon RDS Single-AZ DB instance. A script runs queries at random intervals each day to record the number of new movies that have been added to the database. The script must report a final total during business hours. The company's development team notices that the database performance is inadequate for development tasks when the script is running. A solutions architect must recommend a solution to resolve this issue. Which solution will fulfill this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead?"
options:
  A: "Modify the DB instance to be a Multi-AZ deployment."
  B: "Create a read replica of the database. Configure the script to query only the read replica."
  C: "Instruct the development team to manually export the entries in the database at the end of each day."
  D: "Use Amazon ElastiCache to cache the common queries that the script runs against the database."
