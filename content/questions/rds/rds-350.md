question: "A company uses a 100 GB Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server Single-AZ DB instance in the us-east-1 Region to store customer transactions. The company needs high availability and automatic recovery for the DB instance. The company must also run reports on the RDS database several times a year. The report process causes transactions to take longer than usual to post to the customers’ accounts. The company needs a solution that will improve the performance of the report process. Which combination of steps will fulfill these requirements? (Choose two.)"
options:
  A: "Modify the DB instance from a Single-AZ DB instance to a Multi-AZ deployment."
  B: "Take a snapshot of the current DB instance. Restore the snapshot to a new RDS deployment in another Availability Zone."
  C: "Create a read replica of the DB instance in a different Availability Zone. Point all requests for reports to the read replica."
  D: "Migrate the database to RDS Custom. E. Use RDS Proxy to limit reporting requests to the maintenance window."
answer: "A"
explanation: "Enabling Multi-AZ deployment provides high availability by replicating the database to a standby instance in another Availability Zone. This helps in automatic failover and recovery in case of a primary instance failure. C. Create a read replica of the DB instance in a different Availability Zone. Point all requests for reports to the read replica:  By creating a read replica in a different Availability Zone, you offload the reporting workload from the primary instance, reducing the impact on transaction processing. Read replicas can be used to scale read-heavy workloads and improve overall performance."
