question: "A solutions architect wants all new users to have specific complexity requirements and mandatory rotation periods for IAM user passwords. What should the solutions architect do to accomplish this?"
options:
  A: "Set an overall password policy for the entire AWS account."
  B: "Set a password policy for each IAM user in the AWS account."
  C: "Use third-party vendor software to set password requirements."
  D: "Attach an Amazon CloudWatch rule to the Create_newuser event to set the password with the appropriate requirements."
answer: "A"
explanation: "Amazon Web Services (AWS) allows you to set an account-wide password policy using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). This policy defines the rules and requirements for all IAM users in the AWS account. It's a centralized approach to enforce security measures consistently across all users. In this case, the solutions architect can set the specific complexity requirements and mandatory rotation periods by configuring the password policy at the AWS account level."
