question: "A rapidly growing global ecommerce company is hosting its web application on AWS. The web application includes static content and dynamic content. The website stores online transaction processing (OLTP) data in an Amazon RDS database The website’s users are experiencing slow page loads. Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to resolve this issue? (Choose two.)"
options:
  A: "Configure an Amazon Redshift cluster."
  B: "Set up an Amazon CloudFront distribution."
  C: "Host the dynamic web content in Amazon S3."
  D: "Create a read replica for the RDS DB instance. E. Configure a Multi-AZ deployment for the RDS DB instance."
answer: "B"
explanation: "D. Create a read replica for the RDS DB instance.  Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that can improve the performance of a website by caching static content closer to the users. This reduces latency and improves page load times. Configure CloudFront to distribute static content such as images, styleshfleets, and JavaScript files. This will offload the serving of static assets from the web servers, improving overall website performance.  Creating a read replica for the Amazon RDS database allows you to offload read traffic from the primary database, improving the overall database performance."
