question: "A development team runs monthly resource-intensive tests on its general purpose Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance with Performance Insights enabled. The testing lasts for 48 hours once a month and is the only process that uses the database. The team wants to reduce the cost of running the tests without reducing the compute and memory attributes of the DB instance. Which solution fulfills these requirements MOST cost-effectively?"
options:
  A: "Stop the DB instance when tests are completed. Restart the DB instance when required."
  B: "Use an Auto Scaling policy with the DB instance to automatically scale when tests are completed."
  C: "Create a snapshot when tests are completed. Terminate the DB instance and restore the snapshot when required."
  D: "Modify the DB instance to a low-capacity instance when tests are completed. Modify the DB instance again when required."
answer: "C"
explanation: "By creating a snapshot and terminating the DB instance, you effectively stop incurring costs for the running instance. When you need to run the tests again, you can restore the snapshot to create a new instance and resume testing. This approach allows you to save costs during the periods when the tests are not running."
