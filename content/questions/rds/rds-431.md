question: "A company has developed a new video game as a web application. The application is in a three-tier architecture in a VPC with Amazon RDS for MySQL in the database layer. Several players will compete concurrently online. The game’s developers want to display a top-10 scoreboard in near- real time and offer the ability to stop and restore the game while preserving the current scores. What should a solutions architect do to fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Set up an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached cluster to cache the scores for the web application to display."
  B: "Set up an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster to compute and cache the scores for the web application to display."
  C: "Place an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the web application to cache the scoreboard in a section of the application."
  D: "Create a read replica on Amazon RDS for MySQL to run queries to compute the scoreboard and serve the read traffic to the web application."
answer: "B"
explanation: "Redis is an in-memory data store that is well-suited for caching and real-time data processing. By setting up an ElastiCache for Redis cluster, you can compute and cache the scores in-memory, allowing for fast retrieval and updates."
