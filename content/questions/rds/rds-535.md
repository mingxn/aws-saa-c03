question: "A company wants to provide data scientists with near real-time read-only access to the company's production Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database. The database is currently configured as a Single-AZ database. The data scientists use complex queries that will not affect the production database. The company needs a solution that is highly available. Which solution will fulfill these requirements MOST cost-effectively?"
options:
  A: "Scale the existing production database in a maintenance window to provide enough power for the data scientists."
  B: "Change the setup from a Single-AZ to a Multi-AZ instance deployment with a larger secondary standby instance. Provide the data scientists access to the secondary instance."
  C: "Change the setup from a Single-AZ to a Multi-AZ instance deployment. Provide two additional read replicas for the data scientists."
  D: "Change the setup from a Single-AZ to a Multi-AZ cluster deployment with two readable standby instances. Provide read endpoints to the data scientists."
