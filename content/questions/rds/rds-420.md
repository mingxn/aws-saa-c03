question: "A company wants to use an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB cluster to simplify time-consuming database administrative tasks for production database workloads. The company wants to ensure that its database is highly available and will provide automatic failover support in most scenarios in less than 40 seconds. The company wants to ooad reads off of the primary instance and keep costs as low as possible. Which solution will fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Use an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance deployment. Create one read replica and point the read workload to the read replica."
  B: "Use an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB duster deployment Create two read replicas and point the read workload to the read replicas."
  C: "Use an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance deployment. Point the read workload to the secondary instances in the Multi-AZ pair."
  D: "Use an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment Point the read workload to the reader endpoint."
answer: "D"
