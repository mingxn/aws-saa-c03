question: "A company has a large dataset for its online advertising business stored in an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance in a single Availability Zone. The company wants business reporting queries to run without impacting the write operations to the production DB instance. Which solution fulfills these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Deploy RDS read replicas to process the business reporting queries."
  B: "Scale out the DB instance horizontally by placing it behind an Elastic Load Balancer."
  C: "Scale up the DB instance to a larger instance type to handle write operations and queries."
  D: "Deploy the DB instance in multiple Availability Zones to process the business reporting queries."
answer: "A"
explanation: "Amazon RDS provides the ability to create read replicas of a source DB instance. Read replicas can be used to offload read traffic from the primary (write) DB instance, allowing you to scale read operations horizontally. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you want to run reporting queries without affecting the write performance of the production DB instance."
