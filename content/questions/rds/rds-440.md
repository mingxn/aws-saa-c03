question: "A company used an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance during application testing. Before terminating the DB instance at the end of the test cycle, a solutions architect created two backups. The solutions architect created the first backup by using the mysqldump utility to create a database dump. The solutions architect created the second backup by enabling the final DB snapshot option on RDS termination. The company is now planning for a new test cycle and wants to create a new DB instance from the most recent backup. The company has chosen a MySQL-compatible edition ofAmazon Aurora to host the DB instance. Which solutions will create the new DB instance? (Choose two.)"
options:
  A: "Import the RDS snapshot directly into Aurora."
  B: "Upload the RDS snapshot to Amazon S3. Then import the RDS snapshot into Aurora."
  C: "Upload the database dump to Amazon S3. Then import the database dump into Aurora."
  D: "Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to import the RDS snapshot into Aurora. E. Upload the database dump to Amazon S3. Then use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to import the database dump into Aurora."
answer: "A"
explanation: "C. Upload the database dump to Amazon S3. Then import the database dump into Aurora.  A. Amazon Aurora allows you to directly import an Amazon RDS snapshot into Aurora. This is a straightforward process for migrating data from RDS to Aurora.  C. Uploading the database dump to Amazon S3 and then importing the database dump into Aurora is a common method. You can use the MySQL-compatible version of Aurora to restore the data from a database dump stored in Amazon S3."
