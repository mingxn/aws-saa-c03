question: "A company runs a web application that is backed by Amazon RDS. A new database administrator caused data loss by accidentally editing information in a database table. To help recover from this type of incident, the company wants the ability to restore the database to its state from 5 minutes before any change within the last 30 days. Which feature should the solutions architect include in the design to fulfill this requirement?"
options:
  A: "Read replicas"
  B: "Manual snapshots"
  C: "Automated backups"
  D: "Multi-AZ deployments"
answer: "C"
explanation: "Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) can automatically create backups of your database every day. These backups are like snapshots of your entire database, capturing all the data. They happen automatically, so you don't have to remember to do it. You can decide how long you want to keep these backup snapshots. For example, you might choose to keep them for up to 35 days. This is like saying, \"I want to keep the pictures of my database for the last 35 days.\""
