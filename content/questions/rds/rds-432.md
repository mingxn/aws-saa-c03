question: "An ecommerce company wants to use machine learning (ML) algorithms to build and train models. The company will use the models to visualize complex scenarios and to detect trends in customer data. The architecture team wants to integrate its ML models with a reporting platform to analyze the augmented data and use the data directly in its business intelligence dashboards. Which solution will fulfill these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?"
options:
  A: "Use AWS Glue to create an ML transform to build and train models. Use Amazon OpenSearch Service to visualize the data."
  B: "Use Amazon SageMaker to build and train models. Use Amazon QuickSight to visualize the data."
  C: "Use a pre-built ML Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the AWS Marketplace to build and train models. Use Amazon OpenSearch Service to visualize the data."
  D: "Use Amazon QuickSight to build and train models by using calculated elds. Use Amazon QuickSight to visualize the data."
answer: "B"
explanation: "Amazon SageMaker: It is a fully managed service for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. SageMaker simplifies the ML workflow and reduces operational overhead. It provides a fully managed Jupyter Notebook instance for model development and training, and it can seamlessly integrate with other AWS services. QuickSight can directly connect to Amazon SageMaker models and use the results for visualization without the need for extensive data movement or transformation."
