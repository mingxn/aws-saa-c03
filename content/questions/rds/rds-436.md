question: "A company moved its on-premises PostgreSQL database to an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. The company successfully launched a new product. The workload on the database has increased. The company wants to accommodate the larger workload without adding infrastructure. Which solution will fulfill these requirements MOST cost-effectively?"
options:
  A: "Buy reserved DB instances for the total workload. Make the Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance larger."
  B: "Make the Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance a Multi-AZ DB instance."
  C: "Buy reserved DB instances for the total workload. Add another Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance."
  D: "Make the Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance an on-demand DB instance."
answer: "A"
explanation: "When you commit to using a database instance for a longer time (with reserved instances), AWS gives you a discount compared to paying on a month-to-month basis.  Imagine you have a computer, and you want to make it more powerful because you have more things to do on it. Making the instance larger means upgrading the power of your virtual computer."
