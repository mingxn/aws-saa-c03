question: "A company performs monthly maintenance on its AWS infrastructure. During these maintenance activities, the company needs to rotate the credentials for its Amazon RDS for MySQL databases across multiple AWS Regions. Which solution will fulfill these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?"
options:
  A: "Store the credentials as secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Use multi-Region secret replication for the required Regions. Configure Secrets Manager to rotate the secrets on a schedule."
  B: "Store the credentials as secrets in AWS Systems Manager by creating a secure string parameter. Use multi-Region secret replication for the required Regions. Configure Systems Manager to rotate the secrets on a schedule."
  C: "Store the credentials in an Amazon S3 bucket that has server-side encryption (SSE) enabled. Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to invoke an AWS Lambda function to rotate the credentials."
  D: "Encrypt the credentials as secrets by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) multi-Region customer managed keys. Store the secrets in an Amazon DynamoDB global table. Use an AWS Lambda function to retrieve the secrets from DynamoDB. Use the RDS API to rotate the secrets."
answer: "A"
explanation: "AWS Secrets Manager allows you to store, manage, and rotate secrets, such as database credentials, across multiple AWS Regions. By enabling multi-Region secret replication, you can replicate the secrets across the required Regions to allow for seamless rotation of the credentials during maintenance activities. Additionally, Secrets Manager provides automatic rotation of secrets on a schedule, which would minimize the operational overhead of rotating the credentials on a monthly basis."
