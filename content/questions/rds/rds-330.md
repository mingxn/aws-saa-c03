question: "A company is planning to store data on Amazon RDS DB instances. The company must encrypt the data at rest. What should a solutions architect do to fulfill this requirement?"
options:
  A: "Create a key in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Enable encryption for the DB instances."
  B: "Create an encryption key. Store the key in AWS Secrets Manager. Use the key to encrypt the DB instances."
  C: "Generate a certificate in AWS certificate Manager (ACM). Enable SSL/TLS on the DB instances by using the certificate."
  D: "Generate a certificate in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Enable SSL/TLS on the DB instances by using the certificate."
answer: "A"
explanation: "By creating a key in AWS KMS and enabling encryption for the RDS DB instances, you ensure that the data at rest is encrypted using the specified key.  AWS RDS supports encryption at rest, and you can use AWS KMS to manage the encryption keys. When you enable encryption for an RDS DB instance, you can specify a KMS key to use for encryption."
