question: "A meteorological startup company has a custom web application to sell weather data to its users online. The company uses Amazon DynamoDB to store its data and wants to build a new service that sends an alert to the managers of four internal teams every time a new weather event is recorded. The company does not want this new service to affect the performance of the current application. What should a solutions architect do to fulfill these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?"
options:
  A: "Use DynamoDB transactions to write new event data to the table. Configure the transactions to notify internal teams."
  B: "Have the current application publish a message to four Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics. Have each team subscribe to one topic."
  C: "Enable Amazon DynamoDB Streams on the table. Use triggers to write to a single Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which the teams can subscribe."
  D: "Add a custom attribute to each record to ag new items. Write a cron job that scans the table every minute for items that are new and noties an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue to which the teams can subscribe."
