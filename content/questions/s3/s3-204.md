question: "An online retail company has more than 50 million active customers and receives more than 25,000 orders each day. The company collects purchase data for customers and stores this data in Amazon S3. Additional customer data is stored in Amazon RDS. The company wants to make all the data available to various teams so that the teams can perform analytics. The solution must provide the ability to manage ne-grained permissions for the data and must minimize operational overhead. Which solution will fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Migrate the purchase data to write directly to Amazon RDS. Use RDS access controls to limit access."
  B: "Schedule an AWS Lambda function to periodically copy data from Amazon RDS to Amazon S3. Create an AWS Glue crawler. Use Amazon Athena to query the data. Use S3 policies to limit access."
  C: "Create a data lake by using AWS Lake Formation. Create an AWS Glue JDBC connection to Amazon RDS. Register the S3 bucket in Lake Formation. Use Lake Formation access controls to limit access."
  D: "Create an Amazon Redshift cluster. Schedule an AWS Lambda function to periodically copy data from Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS to Amazon Redshift. Use Amazon Redshift access controls to limit access."
answer: "C"
explanation: "AWS Lake Formation is designed to create a secure and scalable data lake in Amazon S3. By creating a data lake with Lake Formation, you can centrally manage access controls, fine-grained permissions, and define granular data access policies. This simplifies the process of granting and managing permissions for various teams.  In this scenario, you can use AWS Glue to create a JDBC connection to Amazon RDS for accessing the additional customer data. The S3 bucket, where the purchase data is stored, can be registered in Lake Formation. Lake Formation allows you to set up fine-grained access controls and permissions, providing the ability to manage who can access specific data within the data lake."
