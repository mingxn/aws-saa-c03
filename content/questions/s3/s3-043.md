question: "A company has an on-premises application that generates a large amount of time-sensitive data that is backed up to Amazon S3. The application has grown and there are user complaints about internet bandwidth limitations. A solutions architect needs to design a long-term solution that allows for both timely backups to Amazon S3 and with minimal impact on internet connectivity for internal users. Which solution fulfills these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Establish AWS VPN connections and proxy all traffic through a VPC gateway endpoint."
  B: "Establish a new AWS Direct Connect connection and direct backup traffic through this new connection."
  C: "Order daily AWS Snowball devices. Load the data onto the Snowball devices and return the devices to AWS each day."
  D: "Submit a support ticket through the AWS Management Console. Request the removal of S3 service limits from the account."
answer: "B"
explanation: "AWS Direct Connect is a network service that allows you to establish a dedicated network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS. This connection bypasses the public Internet and can provide more reliable, lower-latency communication between your on-premises application and Amazon S3. By directing backup traffic through the AWS Direct Connect connection, you can minimize the impact on your internet bandwidth and ensure timely backups to S3."
