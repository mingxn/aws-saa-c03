question: "A solutions architect is implementing a document review application using an Amazon S3 bucket for storage. The solution must prevent accidental deletion of the documents and ensure that all versions of the documents are available. Users must be able to download, modify, and upload documents. Which combination of actions should be taken to fulfill these requirements? (Choose two.)"
options:
  A: "Enable a read-only bucket ACL."
  B: "Enable versioning on the bucket."
  C: "Attach an IAM policy to the bucket."
  D: "Enable MFA Delete on the bucket. E. Encrypt the bucket using AWS KMS."
answer: "B"
explanation: "D. Enable MFA Delete on the bucket. B. allows multiple versions of objects in the S3 bucket to be stored. This ensures that all versions of the documents are available, even if they are accidentally overwritten or deleted.  D. adds an extra layer of protection against accidental deletion of objects in the bucket. With MFA Delete enabled, a user would need to provide an additional authentication factor to successfully delete objects from the bucket. This helps prevent accidental or unauthorized deletions and provides an extra level of security for critical documents."
