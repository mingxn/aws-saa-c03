question: "A company is using Amazon CloudFront with its website. The company has enabled logging on the CloudFront distribution, and logs are saved in one of the company’s Amazon S3 buckets. The company needs to perform advanced analyses on the logs and build visualizations. What should a solutions architect do to fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Use standard SQL queries in Amazon Athena to analyze the CloudFront logs in the S3 bucket. Visualize the results with AWS Glue."
  B: "Use standard SQL queries in Amazon Athena to analyze the CloudFront logs in the S3 bucket. Visualize the results with Amazon QuickSight."
  C: "Use standard SQL queries in Amazon DynamoDB to analyze the CloudFront logs in the S3 bucket. Visualize the results with AWS Glue."
  D: "Use standard SQL queries in Amazon DynamoDB to analyze the CloudFront logs in the S3 bucket. Visualize the results with Amazon QuickSight."
answer: "B"
explanation: "Amazon Athena allows you to run standard SQL queries directly on the CloudFront logs stored in the S3 bucket. This enables you to perform advanced analyses on the log data.  Once you have queried and processed the CloudFront log data using Athena, you can use Amazon QuickSight for data visualization and building visualizations.  Amazon QuickSight is a business intelligence (BI) tool that allows you to create interactive dashboards and visualizations from various data sources, including the results of Athena queries."
