question: "A company wants to give a customer the ability to use on-premises Microsoft Active Directory to download files that are stored in Amazon S3. The customer’s application uses an SFTP client to download the files. Which solution will fulfill these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead and no changes to the customer’s application?"
options:
  A: "Set up AWS Transfer Family with SFTP for Amazon S3. Configure integrated Active Directory authentication."
  B: "Set up AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to synchronize the on-premises client with Amazon S3. Configure integrated Active Directory authentication."
  C: "Set up AWS DataSync to synchronize between the on-premises location and the S3 location by using AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On)."
  D: "Set up a Windows Amazon EC2 instance with SFTP to connect the on-premises client with Amazon S3. Integrate AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)."
answer: "A"
explanation: "AWS Transfer Family with SFTP for Amazon S3: AWS Transfer Family is a fully managed service that allows you to set up an SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) service for Amazon S3. It enables you to transfer files directly to and from Amazon S3 using the SFTP protocol.  Integrated Active Directory Authentication: AWS Transfer Family allows you to configure authentication with Microsoft Active Directory. By integrating with Active Directory, you can provide users with seamless access to S3 resources using their existing credentials without modifying their applications."
