question: "A company wants to create a mobile app that allows users to stream slow-motion video clips on their mobile devices. Currently, the app captures video clips and uploads the video clips in raw format into an Amazon S3 bucket. The app retrieves these video clips directly from the S3 bucket. However, the videos are large in their raw format. Users are experiencing issues with buffering and playback on mobile devices. The company wants to implement solutions to maximize the performance and scalability of the app while minimizing operational overhead. Which combination of solutions will fulfill these requirements? (Choose two.)"
options:
  A: "Deploy Amazon CloudFront for content delivery and caching."
  B: "Use AWS DataSync to replicate the video files across AW'S Regions in other S3 buckets."
  C: "Use Amazon Elastic Transcoder to convert the video files to more appropriate formats."
  D: "Deploy an Auto Sealing group of Amazon EC2 instances in Local Zones for content delivery and caching. E. Deploy an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances to convert the video files to more appropriate formats."
answer: "A"
explanation: "C. Use Amazon Elastic Transcoder to convert the video files to more appropriate formats.  Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that can distribute your video content globally, reducing latency and improving the speed of delivery. CloudFront can cache the video content at edge locations, which helps in minimizing the load on the S3 bucket and improves playback performance for users.  Amazon Elastic Transcoder can convert the raw video files into more appropriate formats suitable for streaming, reducing the size of the videos. By using Elastic Transcoder, you can create different versions of the video files optimized for different devices, bitrates, and resolutions, which can significantly improve the playback experience on mobile devices"
