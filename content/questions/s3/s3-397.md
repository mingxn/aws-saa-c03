question: "An ecommerce company needs to run a scheduled daily job to aggregate and filter sales records for analytics. The company stores the sales records in an Amazon S3 bucket. Each object can be up to 10 GB in size. Based on the number of sales events, the job can take up to an hour to complete. The CPU and memory usage of the job are constant and are known in advance. A solutions architect needs to minimize the amount of operational effort that is needed for the job to run. Which solution fulfills these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Create an AWS Lambda function that has an Amazon EventBridge notification. Schedule the EventBridge event to run once a day."
  B: "Create an AWS Lambda function. Create an Amazon API Gateway HTTP API, and integrate the API with the function. Create an Amazon EventBridge scheduled event that calls the API and invokes the function."
  C: "Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster with an AWS Fargate launch type. Create an Amazon EventBridge scheduled event that launches an ECS task on the cluster to run the job."
  D: "Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster with an Amazon EC2 launch type and an Auto Scaling group with at least one EC2 instance. Create an Amazon EventBridge scheduled event that launches an ECS task on the cluster to run the job."
