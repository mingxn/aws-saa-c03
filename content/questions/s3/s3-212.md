difficulty: "medium"
question: "A company needs to export its database once a day to Amazon S3 for other teams to access. The exported object size varies between 2 GB and 5 GB. The S3 access pattern for the data is variable and changes rapidly. The data must be immediately available and must remain accessible for up to 3 months. The company needs the most cost-effective solution that will not increase retrieval time. Which S3 storage class should the company use to fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "S3 Intelligent-Tiering"
  B: "S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval"
  C: "S3 Standard"
  D: "S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)"
answer: "A"
explanation: "S3 Intelligent-Tiering is designed to optimize costs by automatically moving objects between two access tiers: frequent and infrequent access. It is suitable for data with unknown or changing access patterns. With S3 Intelligent-Tiering, Amazon S3 automatically and transparently moves objects between access tiers based on changing access patterns. It is cost-effective for a wide range of storage access patterns. The objects can be immediately accessed, and the storage cost is lower than using S3 Standard, making it a suitable choice for varying access patterns."
