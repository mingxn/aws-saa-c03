question: "A company stores raw collected data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The data is used for several types of analytics on behalf of the company's customers. The type of analytics requested determines the access pattern on the S3 objects. The company cannot predict or control the access pattern. The company wants to reduce its S3 costs. Which solution will fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Use S3 replication to transition infrequently accessed objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)"
  B: "Use S3 Lifecycle rules to transition objects from S3 Standard to Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)"
  C: "Use S3 Lifecycle rules to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Intelligent-Tiering"
  D: "Use S3 Inventory to identify and transition objects that have not been accessed from S3 Standard to S3 Intelligent-Tiering"
answer: "C"
explanation: "S3 Intelligent-Tiering is designed to optimize costs by automatically moving objects between two access tiers: frequent and infrequent access. It is well-suited for scenarios where access patterns are unpredictable. Using S3 Lifecycle rules to transition objects to S3 Intelligent-Tiering allows you to take advantage of automatic cost savings based on actual access patterns without the need for manual adjustments."
