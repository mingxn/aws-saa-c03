question: "A company has an application that collects data from IoT sensors on automobiles. The data is streamed and stored in Amazon S3 through Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. The data produces trillions of S3 objects each year. Each morning, the company uses the data from the previous 30 days to retrain a suite of machine learning (ML) models. Four times each year, the company uses the data from the previous 12 months to perform analysis and train other ML models. The data must be available with minimal delay for up to 1 year. After 1 year, the data must be retained for archival purposes. Which storage solution fulfills these requirements MOST cost-effectively?"
options:
  A: "Use the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year."
  B: "Use the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. Configure S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically move objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year."
  C: "Use the S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage class. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year."
  D: "Use the S3 Standard storage class. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 30 days, and then to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year."
answer: "D"
explanation: "S3 Standard Storage Class:  Use S3 Standard for the first 30 days because it's the default storage class for frequently accessed data. This is suitable for the initial period when you need quick and frequent access to your data. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) Storage Class: After the initial 30 days, transition the data to S3 Standard-IA. S3 Standard-IA is designed for data that is accessed less frequently but still requires quick retrieval when needed. It's more cost-effective for data that is accessed less often compared to S3 Standard. S3 Glacier Deep Archive: After 1 year, transition the data from S3 Standard-IA to S3 Glacier Deep Archive using an S3 Lifecycle policy. S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the most cost-effective option for long-term archival storage. This is suitable for storing data that you need to retain for compliance or archival purposes but don't need to access frequently."
