question: "A company has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains critical data. The company must protect the data from accidental deletion. Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to fulfill these requirements? (Choose two.)"
options:
  A: "Enable versioning on the S3 bucket."
  B: "Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket."
  C: "Create a bucket policy on the S3 bucket."
  D: "Enable default encryption on the S3 bucket. E. Create a lifecycle policy for the objects in the S3 bucket."
answer: "A"
explanation: "B. Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket  The two most effective steps a solutions architect can take to protect an Amazon S3 bucket from accidental deletion are:  A. Enable versioning on the S3 bucket. B. Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket.  Versioning keeps multiple versions of objects in the S3 bucket, even when they are overwritten or deleted. This allows you to recover objects that have been accidentally deleted.  MFA Delete requires you to enter a one-time password from a multi-factor authentication (MFA) device before you can delete an object in the S3 bucket. This helps to prevent accidental deletions."
