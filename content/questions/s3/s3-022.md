question: "A solutions architect is using Amazon S3 to design the storage architecture of a new digital media application. The media files must be resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone. Some files are accessed frequently while other files are rarely accessed in an unpredictable pattern. The solutions architect must minimize the costs of storing and retrieving the media files. Which storage option fulfills these requirements?"
options:
  A: "S3 Standard"
  B: "S3 Intelligent-Tiering"
  C: "S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)"
  D: "S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)"
answer: "B"
explanation: "Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering is a storage class that automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on access patterns. It can store objects in two access tiers: the frequent access tier and the infrequent access tier. The frequent access tier is optimized for frequently accessed objects and is charged at the same rate as S3 Standard. The infrequent access tier is optimized for objects that are not accessed frequently and are charged at a lower rate than S3 Standard.  S3 Intelligent Tiering is a good choice for storing media files that are accessed frequently and infrequently in an unpredictable pattern because it automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on access patterns, minimizing storage and retrieval costs. It is also resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone because it stores objects in multiple Availability Zones within a region."
