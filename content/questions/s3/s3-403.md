question: "A developer has an application that uses an AWS Lambda function to upload files to Amazon S3 and needs the required permissions to perform the task. The developer already has an IAM user with valid IAM credentials required for Amazon S3. What should a solutions architect do to grant the permissions?"
options:
  A: "Add required IAM permissions in the resource policy of the Lambda function."
  B: "Create a signed request using the existing IAM credentials in the Lambda function."
  C: "Create a new IAM user and use the existing IAM credentials in the Lambda function."
  D: "Create an IAM execution role with the required permissions and attach the IAM role to the Lambda function."
answer: "D"
explanation: "o grant the necessary permissions to an AWS Lambda function to upload files to Amazon S3, a solutions architect should create an IAM execution role with the required permissions and attach the IAM role to the Lambda function. This approach follows the principle of least privilege and ensures that the Lambda function can only access the resources it needs to perform its specific task."
