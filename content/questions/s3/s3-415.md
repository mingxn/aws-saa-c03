  A: "Create an S3 Lifecycle conguration with a rule to transition the objects in the S3 bucket to S3 Intelligent-Tiering."
  B: "Use the S3 storage class analysis tool to determine the correct tier for each object in the S3 bucket. Move each object to the identied storage tier."
  C: "Create an S3 Lifecycle conguration with a rule to transition the objects in the S3 bucket to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval."
  D: "Create an S3 Lifecycle conguration with a rule to transition the objects in the S3 bucket to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone- IA)."
