question: "A company is developing a new machine learning (ML) model solution on AWS. The models are developed as independent microservices that fetch approximately 1 GB of model data from Amazon S3 at startup and load the data into memory. Users access the models through an asynchronous API. Users can send a request or a batch of requests and specify where the results should be sent. The company provides models to hundreds of users. The usage patterns for the models are irregular. Some models could be unused for days or weeks. Other models could receive batches of thousands of requests at a time. Which design should a solutions architect recommend to fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Direct the requests from the API to a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Deploy the models as AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by the NLB."
  B: "Direct the requests from the API to an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Deploy the models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use AWS App Mesh to scale the instances of the ECS cluster based on the SQS queue size."
  C: "Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Deploy the models as AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by SQS events. Use AWS Auto Scaling to increase the number of vCPUs for the Lambda functions based on the SQS queue size."
  D: "Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Deploy the models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that read from the queue. Enable AWS Auto Scaling on Amazon ECS for both the cluster and copies of the service based on the queue size."
answer: "D"
explanation: "Amazon ECS Services: Deploying the models as Amazon ECS services allows for flexibility in managing the containerized applications. ECS services can efficiently handle the startup process of fetching model data from Amazon S3 and loading it into memory.  Application Load Balancer (ALB): The ALB is used to direct requests from the API to the ECS services. ALB provides advanced routing capabilities and can handle the asynchronous API requirements.  AWS App Mesh: AWS App Mesh can be used to scale the instances of the ECS cluster based on the SQS queue size. This allows for dynamic scaling based on demand, helping to efficiently use resources."
