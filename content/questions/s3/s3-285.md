question: "A company hosts its static website by using Amazon S3. The company wants to add a contact form to its webpage. The contact form will have dynamic server-side components for users to input their name, email address, phone number, and user message. The company anticipates that there will be fewer than 100 site visits each month. Which solution will fulfill these requirements MOST cost-effectively?"
options:
  A: "Host a dynamic contact form page in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Set up Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to connect to any third-party email provider."
  B: "Create an Amazon API Gateway endpoint with an AWS Lambda backend that makes a call to Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)."
  C: "Convert the static webpage to dynamic by deploying Amazon Lightsail. Use client-side scripting to build the contact form. Integrate the form with Amazon WorkMail."
  D: "Create a t2.micro Amazon EC2 instance. Deploy a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) stack to host the webpage. Use client- side scripting to build the contact form. Integrate the form with Amazon WorkMail."
answer: "B"
explanation: "Amazon API Gateway: Acts as the endpoint for the contact form. It enables you to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. AWS Lambda: Serves as the backend for handling the dynamic components of the contact form. Lambda allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES): Can be used to send emails, making it suitable for handling the form submissions. This serverless architecture eliminates the need for managing and maintaining infrastructure, and costs are based on actual usage, making it cost-effective for low-traffic scenarios."
