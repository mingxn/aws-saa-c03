question: "An IoT company is releasing a mattress that has sensors to collect data about a user’s sleep. The sensors will send data to an Amazon S3 bucket. The sensors collect approximately 2 MB of data every night for each mattress. The company must process and summarize the data for each mattress. The results need to be available as soon as possible. Data processing will require 1 GB of memory and will nish within 30 seconds. Which solution will fulfill these requirements MOST cost-effectively?"
options:
  A: "Use AWS Glue with a Scala job"
  B: "Use Amazon EMR with an Apache Spark script"
  C: "Use AWS Lambda with a Python script"
  D: "Use AWS Glue with a PySpark job"
answer: "C"
explanation: "AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales with the number of requests, making it well-suited for event-driven workloads like processing data from IoT devices.  Python is a lightweight and efficient language for data processing tasks.  Lambda allows you to execute code in response to events, such as data arriving in the S3 bucket."
