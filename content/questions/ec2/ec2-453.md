question: "A company wants to implement a backup strategy for Amazon EC2 data and multiple Amazon S3 buckets. Because of regulatory requirements, the company must retain backup files for a specific time period. The company must not alter the files for the duration of the retention period. Which solution will fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Use AWS Backup to create a backup vault that has a vault lock in governance mode. Create the required backup plan."
  B: "Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to create the required automated snapshot policy."
  C: "Use Amazon S3 File Gateway to create the backup. Configure the appropriate S3 Lifecycle management."
  D: "Use AWS Backup to create a backup vault that has a vault lock in compliance mode. Create the required backup plan."
answer: "D"
explanation: "AWS Backup provides a centralized solution for managing backups across various AWS services, including Amazon EC2. By creating a backup vault with a vault lock in compliance mode, the company ensures that the backup files are retained and cannot be altered for the duration of the retention period. Compliance mode is designed to fulfill regulatory requirements for data retention."
