difficulty: "medium"
question: "A company is launching an application on AWS. The application uses an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to direct traffic to at least two Amazon EC2 instances in a single target group. The instances are in an Auto Scaling group for each environment. The company requires a development environment and a production environment. The production environment will have periods of high traffic. Which solution will configure the development environment MOST cost-effectively?"
options:
  A: "Reconfigure the target group in the development environment to have only one EC2 instance as a target."
  B: "Change the ALB balancing algorithm to least outstanding requests."
  C: "Reduce the size of the EC2 instances in both environments."
  D: "Reduce the maximum number of EC2 instances in the development environment’s Auto Scaling group."
answer: "A"
explanation: "For a development environment, where high availability and scalability might not be as critical as in production, having only one EC2 instance as a target in the target group could be a cost-effective solution. This reduces the number of running instances in the development environment when compared to production."
