question: "A gaming company is moving its public scoreboard from a data center to the AWS Cloud. The company uses Amazon EC2 Windows Server instances behind an Application Load Balancer to host its dynamic application. The company needs a highly available storage solution for the application. The application consists of static files and dynamic server-side code. Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to fulfill these requirements? (Choose two.)"
options:
  A: "Store the static files on Amazon S3. Use Amazon CloudFront to cache objects at the edge."
  B: "Store the static files on Amazon S3. Use Amazon ElastiCache to cache objects at the edge."
  C: "Store the server-side code on Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). Mount the EFS volume on each EC2 instance to share the files."
  D: "Store the server-side code on Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. Mount the FSx for Windows File Server volume on each EC2 instance to share the files. E. Store the server-side code on a General Purpose SSD (gp2) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Mount the EBS volume on each EC2 instance to share the files."
answer: "A"
explanation: "D. Store the server-side code on Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. Mount the FSx for Windows File Server volume on each EC2 instance to share the files.  Amazon S3 is a highly scalable and durable object storage service, and it is well-suited for storing static files. Using CloudFront as a content delivery network (CDN) improves the delivery of static content by caching objects at edge locations, reducing latency for end users.  Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides a fully managed Windows file system that is accessible from Windows-based EC2 instances. This is suitable for storing dynamic server-side code that requires file sharing across multiple instances. It offers high availability and supports Windows-native features."
