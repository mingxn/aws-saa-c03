difficulty: "medium"
question: "An Amazon EC2 instance is located in a private subnet in a new VPC. This subnet does not have outbound internet access, but the EC2 instance needs the ability to download monthly security updates from an outside vendor. What should a solutions architect do to fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Create an internet gateway, and attach it to the VPC. Configure the private subnet route table to use the internet gateway as the default route."
  B: "Create a NAT gateway, and place it in a public subnet. Configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT gateway as the default route."
  C: "Create a NAT instance, and place it in the same subnet where the EC2 instance is located. Configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT instance as the default route."
  D: "Create an internet gateway, and attach it to the VPC. Create a NAT instance, and place it in the same subnet where the EC2 instance is located. Configure the private subnet route table to use the internet gateway as the default route."
answer: "B"
explanation: "NAT gateways are designed to provide outbound internet access for instances in private subnets. Placing a NAT gateway in a public subnet and configuring the private subnet's route table to use the NAT gateway as the default route allows the EC2 instance to download security updates while maintaining security."
