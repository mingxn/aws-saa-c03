question: "The customers of a finance company request appointments with financial advisors by sending text messages. A web application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances accepts the appointment requests. The text messages are published to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue through the web application. Another application that runs on EC2 instances then sends fulfilling invitations and fulfilling conrmation email messages to the customers. After successful scheduling, this application stores the fulfilling information in an Amazon DynamoDB database. As the company expands, customers report that their fulfilling invitations are taking longer to arrive. What should a solutions architect recommend to resolve this issue?"
options:
  A: "Add a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster in front of the DynamoDB database."
  B: "Add an Amazon API Gateway API in front of the web application that accepts the appointment requests."
  C: "Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Set the origin as the web application that accepts the appointment requests."
  D: "Add an Auto Scaling group for the application that sends fulfilling invitations. Configure the Auto Scaling group to scale based on the depth of the SQS queue."
answer: "D"
explanation: "To resolve the issue of longer delivery times for fulfilling invitations, the solutions architect can recommend adding an Auto Scaling group for the application that sends fulfilling invitations and configuring the Auto Scaling group to scale based on the depth of the SQS queue. This will allow the application to scale up as the number of appointment requests increases, improving the performance and delivery times of the fulfilling invitations."
