question: "A company is running a custom application on Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances. The application has frontend nodes that need to run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and backend nodes that need to run only for a short time based on workload. The number of backend nodes varies during the day. The company needs to scale out and scale in more instances based on workload. Which solution will fulfill these requirements MOST cost-effectively?"
options:
  A: "Use Reserved Instances for the frontend nodes. Use AWS Fargate for the backend nodes."
  B: "Use Reserved Instances for the frontend nodes. Use Spot Instances for the backend nodes."
  C: "Use Spot Instances for the frontend nodes. Use Reserved Instances for the backend nodes."
  D: "Use Spot Instances for the frontend nodes. Use AWS Fargate for the backend nodes."
answer: "B"
explanation: "Reserved Instances (RIs) for Frontend Nodes: Since the frontend nodes need to run 24/7, Reserved Instances provide a significant cost savings compared to On-Demand pricing. RIs are a commitment to a consistent usage pattern, making them suitable for instances that need to run continuously.  Spot Instances for Backend Nodes: Spot Instances are a cost-effective option for workloads that can be interrupted or are flexible regarding availability. As the number of backend nodes varies during the day, using Spot Instances allows you to take advantage of spare capacity at a lower cost. Spot Instances are suitable for short-lived, scalable, and flexible workloads."
