question: "A company needs a backup strategy for its three-tier stateless web application. The web application runs on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group with a dynamic scaling policy that is configured to respond to scaling events. The database tier runs on Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. The web application does not require temporary local storage on the EC2 instances. The company’s recovery point objective (RPO) is 2 hours. The backup strategy must maximize scalability and optimize resource utilization for this environment. Which solution will fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Take snapshots of Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes of the EC2 instances and database every 2 hours to fulfill the RPO."
  B: "Configure a snapshot lifecycle policy to take Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots. Enable automated backups in Amazon RDS to fulfill the RPO."
  C: "Retain the latest Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) of the web and application tiers. Enable automated backups in Amazon RDS and use point-in-time recovery to fulfill the RPO."
  D: "Take snapshots of Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes of the EC2 instances every 2 hours. Enable automated backups in Amazon RDS and use point-in-time recovery to fulfill the RPO."
answer: "C"
explanation: "Snapshots of EBS volumes would be necessary if you want to back up the entire EC2 instance, including any applications and temporary data stored on the EBS volumes attached to the instances. When you take a snapshot of an EBS volume, it backs up the entire contents of that volume. This ensures that you can restore the entire EC2 instance to a specific point in time more quickly. However, if there is no temporary data stored on the EBS volumes, then snapshots of EBS volumes are not necessary."
