question: "A research laboratory needs to process approximately 8 TB of data. The laboratory requires sub-millisecond latencies and a minimum throughput of 6 GBps for the storage subsystem. Hundreds of Amazon EC2 instances that run Amazon Linux will distribute and process the data. Which solution will fulfill the performance requirements?"
options:
  A: "Create an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system. Sat each volume’ tiering policy to ALL. Import the raw data into the file system. Mount the la system on the EC2 instances."
  B: "Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the raw data. Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system that uses persistent SSD storage. Select the option to import data from and export data to Amazon S3. Mount the file system on the EC2 instances."
  C: "Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the raw data. Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system that uses persistent HDD storage. Select the option to import data from and export data to Amazon S3. Mount the file system on the EC2 instances."
  D: "Create an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system. Set each volume’s tiering policy to NONE. Import the raw data into the file system. Mount the file system on the EC2 instances."
answer: "B"
explanation: "Amazon FSx for Lustre is a high-performance file system designed for use with compute-intensive workloads. It provides sub-millisecond latencies and is well-suited for scenarios where high throughput is required. Using persistent SSD storage for the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system ensures that it fulfills the minimum throughput requirement of 6 GBps. Storing the raw data in an Amazon S3 bucket allows for scalable and durable storage, and the integration with FSx for Lustre allows seamless importing and exporting of data to and from S3. This solution is designed to provide the required performance characteristics for processing large amounts of data with hundreds of EC2 instances."
