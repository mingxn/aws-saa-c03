question: "A company is migrating its on-premises workload to the AWS Cloud. The company already uses several Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon RDS DB instances. The company wants a solution that automatically starts and stops the EC2 instances and DB instances outside of business hours. The solution must minimize cost and infrastructure maintenance. Which solution will fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Scale the EC2 instances by using elastic resize. Scale the DB instances to zero outside of business hours."
  B: "Explore AWS Marketplace for partner solutions that will automatically start and stop the EC2 instances and DB instances on a schedule."
  C: "Launch another EC2 instance. Configure a crontab schedule to run shell scripts that will start and stop the existing EC2 instances and DB instances on a schedule."
  D: "Create an AWS Lambda function that will start and stop the EC2 instances and DB instances. Configure Amazon EventBridge to invoke the Lambda function on a schedule."
answer: "D"
explanation: "AWS Lambda Function: Create a Lambda function that contains the logic to start and stop the EC2 instances and DB instances. Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It is a cost-effective and maintenance-free solution.  Amazon EventBridge: Configure EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) to invoke the Lambda function on a schedule. EventBridge provides a reliable and scalable way to schedule the execution of Lambda functions at specified intervals, such as starting and stopping instances during business hours."
