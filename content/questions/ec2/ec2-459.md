question: "A company uses AWS Organizations to run workloads within multiple AWS accounts. A tagging policy adds department tags to AWS resources when the company creates tags. An accounting team needs to determine spending on Amazon EC2 consumption. The accounting team must determine which departments are responsible for the costs regardless ofAWS account. The accounting team has access to AWS Cost Explorer for all AWS accounts within the organization and needs to access all reports from Cost Explorer. Which solution fulfills these requirements in the MOST operationally ecient way?"
options:
  A: "From the Organizations management account billing console, activate a user-dened cost allocation tag named department. Create one cost report in Cost Explorer grouping by tag name, and filter by EC2."
  B: "From the Organizations management account billing console, activate an AWS-dened cost allocation tag named department. Create one cost report in Cost Explorer grouping by tag name, and filter by EC2."
  C: "From the Organizations member account billing console, activate a user-dened cost allocation tag named department. Create one cost report in Cost Explorer grouping by the tag name, and filter by EC2."
  D: "From the Organizations member account billing console, activate an AWS-dened cost allocation tag named department. Create one cost report in Cost Explorer grouping by tag name, and filter by EC2."
answer: "A"
explanation: "While AWS provides AWS-defined tags, the use of a user-defined tag provides flexibility in terms of naming and tagging conventions. Activating the tag at the Organizations management account level ensures that the tag is applied to resources across all member accounts."
