difficulty: "medium"
question: "An application running on an Amazon EC2 instance in VPC-A needs to access files in another EC2 instance in VPC-B. Both VPCs are in separate AWS accounts. The network administrator needs to design a solution to configure secure access to EC2 instance in VPC-B from VPC-A. The connectivity should not have a single point of failure or bandwidth concerns. Which solution will fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Set up a VPC peering connection between VPC-A and VPC-B."
  B: "Set up VPC gateway endpoints for the EC2 instance running in VPC-B."
  C: "Attach a virtual private gateway to VPC-B and set up routing from VPC-A."
  D: "Create a private virtual interface (VIF) for the EC2 instance running in VPC-B and add appropriate routes from VPC-A."
answer: "A"
explanation: "A VPC peering connection allows secure communication between instances in different VPCs using private IP addresses without the need for internet gateways, VPN connections, or NAT devices. By setting it up, the application running in VPC-A can directly access the EC2 in VPC-B without going through the public internet or any single point of failure."
