question: "An application running on an Amazon EC2 instance in VPC-A needs to access files in another EC2 instance in VPC-B. Both VPCs are in separate AWS accounts.

Which solution will fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Set up a VPC peering connection between VPC-A and VPC-B."
  B: "Set up VPC gateway endpoints for the EC2 instance running in VPC-B."
  C: "Attach a virtual private gateway to VPC-B and set up routing from VPC-A."
  D: "Create a private virtual interface (VIF) for the EC2 instance running in VPC-B and add appropriate routes from VPC-A."
