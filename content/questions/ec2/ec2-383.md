question: "A company is planning to migrate a commercial off-the-shelf application from its on-premises data center to AWS. The software has a software licensing model using sockets and cores with predictable capacity and uptime requirements. The company wants to use its existing licenses, which were purchased earlier this year. Which Amazon EC2 pricing option is the MOST cost-effective?"
options:
  A: "Dedicated Reserved Hosts"
  B: "Dedicated On-Demand Hosts"
  C: "Dedicated Reserved Instances"
  D: "Dedicated On-Demand Instances"
answer: "A"
explanation: "A Dedicated Host is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use. When you launch instances on a Dedicated Host, those instances run on the dedicated hardware of that host. Dedicated Hosts provide control over the placement of instances for compliance, licensing, or regulatory requirements. You can purchase Dedicated Hosts on a reservation model (Reserved Hosts) or pay for them on-demand. The host remains dedicated to you for the specified term in the case of Reserved Hosts. Dedicated Hosts can be useful for workloads with specific licensing models tied to physical sockets or cores."
