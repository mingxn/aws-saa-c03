question: "A company wants to run an in-memory database for a latency-sensitive application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances. The application processes more than 100,000 transactions each minute and requires high network throughput. A solutions architect needs to provide a cost- effective network design that minimizes data transfer charges. Which solution fulfills these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Launch all EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone within the same AWS Region. Specify a placement group with cluster strategy when launching EC2 instances."
  B: "Launch all EC2 instances in different Availability Zones within the same AWS Region. Specify a placement group with partition strategy when launching EC2 instances."
  C: "Deploy an Auto Scaling group to launch EC2 instances in different Availability Zones based on a network utilization target."
  D: "Deploy an Auto Scaling group with a step scaling policy to launch EC2 instances in different Availability Zones."
answer: "A"
explanation: "A placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. The \"cluster\" strategy for placement groups places instances in close proximity to each other, providing low-latency, high-throughput communication between instances. By launching all EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone within the same AWS Region, you minimize data transfer charges because data transfer within the same Availability Zone is not subject to additional costs."
