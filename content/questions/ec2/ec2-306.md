question: "A company wants to run an in-memory database for a latency-sensitive application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances. The application processes more than 100,000 transactions each minute and requires high network throughput. A solutions architect needs to provide a cost- effective network design that minimizes data transfer charges. Which solution fulfills these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Launch all EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone within the same AWS Region. Specify a placement group with cluster strategy when launching EC2 instances."
  B: "Launch all EC2 instances in different Availability Zones within the same AWS Region. Specify a placement group with partition strategy when launching EC2 instances."
  C: "Deploy an Auto Scaling group to launch EC2 instances in different Availability Zones based on a network utilization target."
  D: "Deploy an Auto Scaling group with a step scaling policy to launch EC2 instances in different Availability Zones."
answer: "A"
