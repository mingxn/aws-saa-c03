Which set of additional steps should the solutions architect take to fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to two. Deploy one On-Demand Instance in one Availability Zone and one On-Demand Instance in a second Availability Zone."
  B: "Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to four. Deploy two On-Demand Instances in one Availability Zone and two On-Demand Instances in a second Availability Zone."
  C: "Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to two. Deploy four Spot Instances in one Availability Zone."
  D: "Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to four. Deploy two On-Demand Instances in one Availability Zone and two Spot Instances in a second Availability Zone."
