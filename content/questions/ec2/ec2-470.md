question: "A company has applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances with IPv6 addresses. The applications must initiate communications with other external applications using the internet. However the company’s security policy states that any external service cannot initiate a connection to the EC2 instances. What should a solutions architect recommend to resolve this issue?"
options:
  A: "Create a NAT gateway and make it the destination of the subnet's route table"
  B: "Create an internet gateway and make it the destination of the subnet's route table"
  C: "Create a virtual private gateway and make it the destination of the subnet's route table"
  D: "Create an egress-only internet gateway and make it the destination of the subnet's route table"
answer: "D"
explanation: "An egress-only internet gateway is used for IPv6 traffic leaving the VPC to reach the internet. It allows outbound communication initiated by resources inside the VPC but prevents incoming traffic initiated from the internet. Configuring the subnet's route table to use the egress-only internet gateway as the destination ensures that IPv6 traffic initiated from EC2 instances can reach external services while blocking unsolicited incoming traffic."
