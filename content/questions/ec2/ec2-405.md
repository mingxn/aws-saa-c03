question: "A solutions architect is designing the architecture for a software demonstration environment. The environment will run on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The system will experience signicant increases in traffic during working hours but is not required to operate on weekends. Which combination of actions should the solutions architect take to ensure that the system can scale to fulfill demand? (Choose two.)"
options:
  A: "Use AWS Auto Scaling to adjust the ALB capacity based on request rate."
  B: "Use AWS Auto Scaling to scale the capacity of the VPC internet gateway."
  C: "Launch the EC2 instances in multiple AWS Regions to distribute the load across Regions."
  D: "Use a target trafficking scaling policy to scale the Auto Scaling group based on instance CPU utilization. E. Use scheduled scaling to change the Auto Scaling group minimum, maximum, and desired capacity to zero for weekends. Revert to the default values at the start of the week."
