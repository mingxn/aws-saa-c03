question: "A solutions architect is designing the architecture for a software demonstration environment. The environment will run on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The system will experience signicant increases in traffic during working hours but is not required to operate on weekends. Which combination of actions should the solutions architect take to ensure that the system can scale to fulfill demand? (Choose two.)"
options:
  A: "Use AWS Auto Scaling to adjust the ALB capacity based on request rate."
  B: "Use AWS Auto Scaling to scale the capacity of the VPC internet gateway."
  C: "Launch the EC2 instances in multiple AWS Regions to distribute the load across Regions."
  D: "Use a target trafficking scaling policy to scale the Auto Scaling group based on instance CPU utilization. E. Use scheduled scaling to change the Auto Scaling group minimum, maximum, and desired capacity to zero for weekends. Revert to the default values at the start of the week."
answer: "A"
explanation: "E. Use scheduled scaling to change the Auto Scaling group minimum, maximum, and desired capacity to zero for weekends. Revert to the default values at the start of the week.  This allows the ALB to automatically scale its capacity based on the incoming request rate, ensuring that the system can handle varying traffic loads.  This allows you to save costs and resources during weekends when the system is not required to operate. Scaling down the Auto Scaling group to zero instances during weekends and reverting to the default values at the start of the week ensures that you only incur costs when the system is actively in use."
