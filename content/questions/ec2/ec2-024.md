question: "A company observes an increase in Amazon EC2 costs in its most recent bill. The billing team notices unwanted vertical scaling of instance types for a couple of EC2 instances. A solutions architect needs to create a graph comparing the last 2 months of EC2 costs and perform an in-depth analysis to identify the root cause of the vertical scaling. How should the solutions architect generate the information with the LEAST operational overhead?"
options:
  A: "Use AWS Budgets to create a budget report and compare EC2 costs based on instance types."
  B: "Use Cost Explorer's granular filtering feature to perform an in-depth analysis of EC2 costs based on instance types."
  C: "Use graphs from the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard to compare EC2 costs based on instance types for the last 2 months."
  D: "Use AWS Cost and Usage Reports to create a report and send it to an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Amazon QuickSight with Amazon S3 as a source to generate an interactive graph based on instance types."
