question: "A company uses high block storage capacity to runs its workloads on premises. The company's daily peak input and output transactions per second are not more than 15,000 IOPS. The company wants to migrate the workloads to Amazon EC2 and to provision disk performance independent of storage capacity. Which Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume type will fulfill these requirements MOST cost-effectively?"
options:
  A: "GP2 volume type"
  B: "io2 volume type"
  C: "GP3 volume type"
  D: "io1 volume type"
answer: "C"
explanation: "General Purpose SSD (gp3) volumes are designed to provide a balance of price and performance. They allow you to provision IOPS independently of storage capacity, making them suitable for workloads with varying performance requirements. GP3 volumes offer a lower price per IOPS compared to io1 volumes and are a good fit for general-purpose workloads."
