question: "A company hosts its web application on AWS using seven Amazon EC2 instances. The company requires that the IP addresses of all healthy EC2 instances be returned in response to DNS queries. Which policy should be used to fulfill this requirement?"
options:
  A: "Simple routing policy"
  B: "Latency routing policy"
  C: "Multivalue routing policy"
  D: "Geolocation routing policy"
answer: "C"
explanation: "The multivalue routing policy returns multiple healthy IP addresses for the resource in response to DNS queries. This is suitable for distributing traffic across multiple resources, such as EC2 instances, and fulfilling the specified requirement.  Simple Routing: Gives one answer (IP address). Latency Routing: Considers the fastest route but still gives one answer. Multivalue Routing: Gives multiple answers (multiple IP addresses). Geolocation Routing: Directs based on user location but typically gives one answer."
