question: "A solutions architect is designing the architecture of a new application being deployed to the AWS Cloud. The application will run on Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances and will automatically scale across multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances will scale up and down frequently throughout the day. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) will handle the load distribution. The architecture needs to support distributed session data management. The company is willing to make changes to code if needed. What should the solutions architect do to ensure that the architecture supports distributed session data management?"
options:
  A: "Use Amazon ElastiCache to manage and store session data."
  B: "Use session anity (sticky sessions) of the ALB to manage session data."
  C: "Use Session Manager from AWS Systems Manager to manage the session."
  D: "Use the GetSessionToken API operation in AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to manage the session."
answer: "A"
explanation: "Amazon ElastiCache is a fully managed, in-memory data store service. It is commonly used for caching and session management in distributed applications. By utilizing ElastiCache for session data management, you can store and retrieve session data in a scalable and high-performance manner. The use of ElastiCache allows for a distributed and shared data store for session management across multiple instances and Availability Zones."
