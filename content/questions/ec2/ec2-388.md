The web application is not working as intended. The web application reports that it cannot connect to the database. The database is conrmed to be up and running. All congurations for the network ACLs, security groups, and route tables are still in their default states. What should a solutions architect recommend to x the application?"
options:
  A: "Add an explicit rule to the private subnet’s network ACL to allow traffic from the web tier’s EC2 instances."
  B: "Add a route in the VPC route table to allow traffic between the web tier’s EC2 instances and the database tier."
  C: "Deploy the web tier's EC2 instances and the database tier’s RDS instance into two separate VPCs, and configure VPC peering."
  D: "Add an inbound rule to the security group of the database tier’s RDS instance to allow traffic from the web tiers security group."
