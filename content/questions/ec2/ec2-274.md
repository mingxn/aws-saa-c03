question: "A company runs an application on Amazon EC2 instances. The company needs to implement a disaster recovery (DR) solution for the application. The DR solution needs to have a recovery time objective (RTO) of less than 4 hours. The DR solution also needs to use the fewest possible AWS resources during normal operations. Which solution will fulfill these requirements in the MOST operationally ecient way?"
options:
  A: "Create Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to back up the EC2 instances. Copy the AMIs to a secondary AWS Region. Automate infrastructure deployment in the secondary Region by using AWS Lambda and custom scripts."
  B: "Create Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to back up the EC2 instances. Copy the AMIs to a secondary AWS Region. Automate infrastructure deployment in the secondary Region by using AWS CloudFormation."
  C: "Launch EC2 instances in a secondary AWS Region. Keep the EC2 instances in the secondary Region active at all times."
  D: "Launch EC2 instances in a secondary Availability Zone. Keep the EC2 instances in the secondary Availability Zone active at all times."
answer: "B"
explanation: "By creating Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to back up the EC2 instances and copying them to a secondary AWS Region, the company can ensure that they have a reliable backup in the event of a disaster. By using AWS CloudFormation to automate infrastructure deployment in the secondary Region, the company can minimize the amount of time and effort required to set up the DR solution."
