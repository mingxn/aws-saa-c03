question: "A company is using a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances to ingest data from on-premises data sources. The data is in JSON format and ingestion rates can be as high as 1 MB/s. When an EC2 instance is rebooted, the data in-ight is lost. The company’s data science team wants to query ingested data in near-real time. Which solution provides near-real-time data querying that is scalable with minimal data loss?"
options:
  A: "Publish data to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, Use Kinesis Data Analytics to query the data."
  B: "Publish data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose with Amazon Redshift as the destination. Use Amazon Redshift to query the data."
  C: "Store ingested data in an EC2 instance store. Publish data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose with Amazon S3 as the destination. Use Amazon Athena to query the data."
  D: "Store ingested data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Publish data to Amazon ElastiCache for Redis. Subscribe to the Redis channel to query the data."
answer: "A"
explanation: "Amazon Kinesis Data Streams: It is a scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. It allows you to ingest, buffer, and process streaming data in real time. In this scenario, you can publish data to a Kinesis Data Stream from your EC2 instances.  Kinesis Data Analytics: It provides an SQL-like language for querying and analyzing data in real time. You can use Kinesis Data Analytics to process and analyze the ingested data directly within the Kinesis pipeline."
