question: "A company offers a food delivery service that is growing rapidly. Because of the growth, the company’s order processing system is experiencing scaling problems during peak traffic hours. The current architecture includes the following: • A group of Amazon EC2 instances that run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to collect orders from the application • Another group of EC2 instances that run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to fulll orders The order collection process occurs quickly, but the order fulllment process can take longer. Data must not be lost because of a scaling event. A solutions architect must ensure that the order collection process and the order fulllment process can both scale properly during peak traffic hours. The solution must optimize utilization of the company’s AWS resources. Which solution fulfills these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to monitor the CPU of each instance in the Auto Scaling groups. Configure each Auto Scaling group’s minimum capacity according to peak workload values."
  B: "Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to monitor the CPU of each instance in the Auto Scaling groups. Configure a CloudWatch alarm to invoke an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that creates additional Auto Scaling groups on demand."
  C: "Provision two Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues: one for order collection and another for order fulllment. Configure the EC2 instances to poll their respective queue. Scale the Auto Scaling groups based on notifications that the queues send."
  D: "Provision two Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues: one for order collection and another for order fulllment. Configure the EC2 instances to poll their respective queue. Create a metric based on a backlog per instance calculation. Scale the Auto Scaling groups based on this metric."
