question: "A company has a multi-tier application deployed on several Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. An Amazon RDS for Oracle instance is the application’ s data layer that uses Oracle-specific PL/SQL functions. traffic to the application has been steadily increasing. This is causing the EC2 instances to become overloaded and the RDS instance to run out of storage. The Auto Scaling group does not have any scaling metrics and denes the minimum healthy instance count only. The company predicts that traffic will continue to increase at a steady but unpredictable rate before leveling off. What should a solutions architect do to ensure the system can automatically scale for the increased traffic? (Choose two.)"
options:
  A: "Configure storage Auto Scaling on the RDS for Oracle instance."
  B: "Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora to use Auto Scaling storage."
  C: "Configure an alarm on the RDS for Oracle instance for low free storage space."
  D: "Configure the Auto Scaling group to use the average CPU as the scaling metric. E. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use the average free memory as the scaling metric."
answer: "A"
explanation: "This option allows the RDS instance to automatically scale its storage based on the actual storage usage, ensuring that you don't run out of storage.  D. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use the average CPU as the scaling metric.  By using CPU utilization as a scaling metric, the Auto Scaling group can dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on the application's demand. This helps in handling increased traffic and preventing overload on existing instances."
