question: "A company has created an image analysis application in which users can upload photos and add photo frames to their images. The users upload images and metadata to indicate which photo frames they want to add to their images. The application uses a single Amazon EC2 instance and Amazon DynamoDB to store the metadata. The application is becoming more popular, and the number of users is increasing. The company expects the number of concurrent users to vary signicantly depending on the time of day and day of week. The company must ensure that the application can scale to fulfill the needs of the growing user base. Which solution meats these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Use AWS Lambda to process the photos. Store the photos and metadata in DynamoDB."
  B: "Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to process the photos and to store the photos and metadata."
  C: "Use AWS Lambda to process the photos. Store the photos in Amazon S3. Retain DynamoDB to store the metadata."
  D: "Increase the number of EC2 instances to three. Use Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes to store the photos and metadata."
