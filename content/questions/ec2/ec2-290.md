question: "A company hosts a web application on multiple Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2 instances are in an Auto Scaling group that scales in response to user demand. The company wants to optimize cost savings without making a long-term commitment. Which EC2 instance purchasing option should a solutions architect recommend to fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Dedicated Instances only"
  B: "On-Demand Instances only"
  C: "A mix of On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances"
  D: "A mix of On-Demand Instances and Reserved Instances"
answer: "C"
explanation: "On-Demand Instances: These instances are charged per hour or per second of usage, without any upfront payment or long-term commitment. While they offer flexibility, they are usually more expensive compared to other purchasing options.  Spot Instances: These are spare compute capacity in the AWS cloud available at a lower price compared to On-Demand Instances. However, they can be terminated by AWS with little notice if the capacity is needed elsewhere. Spot Instances are suitable for workloads that are fault-tolerant and can handle interruptions."
