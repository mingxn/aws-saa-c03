question: "A company uses an Amazon EC2 instance to run a script to poll for and process messages in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. The company wants to reduce operational costs while maintaining its ability to process a growing number of messages that are added to the queue. What should a solutions architect recommend to fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Increase the size of the EC2 instance to process messages faster."
  B: "Use Amazon EventBridge to turn off the EC2 instance when the instance is underutilized."
  C: "Migrate the script on the EC2 instance to an AWS Lambda function with the appropriate runtime."
  D: "Use AWS Systems Manager Run Command to run the script on demand."
answer: "C"
explanation: "AWS Lambda: Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales based on the number of incoming requests. Cost-Efficiency: With Lambda, you only pay for the compute time consumed during code execution. This can be more cost-effective than running and maintaining an EC2 instance, especially for sporadic or event-driven workloads. Automatic Scaling: Lambda automatically scales based on the number of incoming events. As the number of messages in the SQS queue grows, Lambda can scale out to handle the increased workload. Event-Driven: Lambda is well-suited for event-driven architectures, making it a good fit for scenarios where messages are added to an SQS queue."
