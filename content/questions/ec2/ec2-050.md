question: "A company has a production workload that runs on 1,000 Amazon EC2 Linux instances. The workload is powered by third-party software. The company needs to patch the third-party software on all EC2 instances as quickly as possible to remediate a critical security vulnerability. What should a solutions architect do to fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Create an AWS Lambda function to apply the patch to all EC2 instances."
  B: "Configure AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to apply the patch to all EC2 instances."
  C: "Schedule an AWS Systems Manager maintenance window to apply the patch to all EC2 instances."
  D: "Use AWS Systems Manager Run Command to run a custom command that applies the patch to all EC2 instances."
answer: "D"
explanation: "AWS Systems Manager Run Command allows the company to run commands or scripts on multiple EC2 instances. By using Run Command, the company can quickly and easily apply the patch to all 1,000 EC2 instances to remediate the security vulnerability.  Creating an AWS Lambda function to apply the patch to all EC2 instances would not be a suitable solution, as Lambda functions are not designed to run on EC2 instances. Configuring AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to apply the patch to all EC2 instances would not be a suitable solution, as Patch Manager is not designed to apply third-party software patches. Scheduling an AWS Systems Manager maintenance window to apply the patch to all EC2 instances would not be a suitable solution, as maintenance windows are not designed to apply patches to third-party software."
