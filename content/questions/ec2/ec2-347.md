question: "A company has an application that is running on Amazon EC2 instances. A solutions architect has standardized the company on a particular instance family and various instance sizes based on the current needs of the company. The company wants to maximize cost savings for the application over the next 3 years. The company needs to be able to change the instance family and sizes in the next 6 months based on application popularity and usage. Which solution will fulfill these requirements MOST cost-effectively?"
options:
  A: "Compute Savings Plan"
  B: "EC2 Instance Savings Plan"
  C: "Zonal Reserved Instances"
  D: "Standard Reserved Instances"
answer: "A"
explanation: "Compute Savings Plans provide significant cost savings over On-Demand pricing in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of compute usage (measured in $/hr) for a 1 or 3 year period. They offer flexibility by allowing you to switch between instance families, sizes, and AZs (Availability Zones) while still benefiting from the savings plan pricing. This aligns well with the company's requirement to change instance family and sizes based on application needs."
