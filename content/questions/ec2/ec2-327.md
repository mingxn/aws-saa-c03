question: "A solutions architect must secure a VPC network that hosts Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2 instances contain highly sensitive data and run in a private subnet. According to company policy, the EC2 instances that run in the VPC can access only approved third-party software repositories on the internet for software product updates that use the third party’s URL. Other internet traffic must be blocked. Which solution fulfills these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Update the route table for the private subnet to route the outbound traffic to an AWS Network Firewall rewall. Configure domain list rule groups."
  B: "Set up an AWS WAF web ACL. Create a custom set of rules that filter traffic requests based on source and destination IP address range sets."
  C: "Implement strict inbound security group rules. Configure an outbound rule that allows traffic only to the authorized software repositories on the internet by specifying the URLs."
  D: "Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of the EC2 instances. Direct all outbound traffic to the ALB. Use a URL-based rule listener in the ALB’s target group for outbound access to the internet."
