question: "A company runs a highly available image-processing application on Amazon EC2 instances in a single VPC. The EC2 instances run inside several subnets across multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances do not communicate with each other. However, the EC2 instances download images from Amazon S3 and upload images to Amazon S3 through a single NAT gateway. The company is concerned about data transfer charges. What is the MOST cost-effective way for the company to avoid Regional data transfer charges?"
options:
  A: "Launch the NAT gateway in each Availability Zone."
  B: "Replace the NAT gateway with a NAT instance."
  C: "Deploy a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3."
  D: "Provision an EC2 Dedicated Host to run the EC2 instances."
answer: "C"
explanation: "S3 VPC endpoint provides a way for an S3 request to be routed through to the Amazon S3 service, without having to connect a subnet to an internet gateway. The S3 VPC endpoint is what's known as a gateway endpoint."
