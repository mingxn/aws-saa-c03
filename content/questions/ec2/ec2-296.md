question: "A development team has launched a new application that is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances inside a development VPC. A solutions architect needs to create a new VPC in the same account. The new VPC will be peered with the development VPC. The VPC CIDR block for the development VPC is 192.168.0.0/24. The solutions architect needs to create a CIDR block for the new VPC. The CIDR block must be valid for a VPC peering connection to the development VPC. What is the SMALLEST CIDR block that fulfills these requirements?"
options:
  A: "10.0.1.0/32"
  B: "192.168.0.0/24"
  C: "192.168.1.0/32"
  D: "10.0.1.0/24"
answer: "D"
explanation: "This is a valid CIDR block that does not overlap with the existing development VPC (192.168.0.0/24).  Therefore, this is the SMALLEST CIDR block that fulfills the requirements."
