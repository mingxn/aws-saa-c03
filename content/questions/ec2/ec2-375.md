question: "An ecommerce company is building a distributed application that involves several serverless functions and AWS services to complete order- processing tasks. These tasks require manual approvals as part of the workow. A solutions architect needs to design an architecture for the order-processing application. The solution must be able to combine multiple AWS Lambda functions into responsive serverless applications. The solution also must orchestrate data and services that run on Amazon EC2 instances, containers, or on-premises servers. Which solution will fulfill these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?"
options:
  A: "Use AWS Step Functions to build the application."
  B: "Integrate all the application components in an AWS Glue job."
  C: "Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to build the application."
  D: "Use AWS Lambda functions and Amazon EventBridge events to build the application."
answer: "A"
explanation: "Step Functions provide a way to coordinate and orchestrate multiple AWS services, including AWS Lambda functions, in a serverless workflow. They allow you to build applications by connecting various serverless functions and services without managing the underlying infrastructure."
