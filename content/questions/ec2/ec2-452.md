question: "A company runs a Java-based job on an Amazon EC2 instance. The job runs every hour and takes 10 seconds to run. The job runs on a scheduled interval and consumes 1 GB of memory. The CPU utilization of the instance is low except for short surges during which the job uses the maximum CPU available. The company wants to optimize the costs to run the job. Which solution will fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Use AWS App2Container (A2C) to containerize the job. Run the job as an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) task on AWS Fargate with 0.5 virtual CPU (vCPU) and 1 GB of memory."
  B: "Copy the code into an AWS Lambda function that has 1 GB of memory. Create an Amazon EventBridge scheduled rule to run the code each hour."
  C: "Use AWS App2Container (A2C) to containerize the job. Install the container in the existing Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Ensure that the schedule stops the container when the task nishes."
  D: "Configure the existing schedule to stop the EC2 instance at the completion of the job and restart the EC2 instance when the next job starts."
answer: "B"
explanation: "AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales based on the number of requests, making it cost-effective for sporadic workloads. Scheduled Rule with Amazon EventBridge:  Amazon EventBridge allows you to schedule events at specified intervals. By creating a scheduled rule, you can trigger the Lambda function to run the Java-based job every hour."
