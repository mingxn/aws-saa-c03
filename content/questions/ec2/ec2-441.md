question: "A company hosts a multi-tier web application on Amazon Linux Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. The company observes that the Auto Scaling group launches more On-Demand Instances when the application's end users access high volumes of static web content. The company wants to optimize cost. What should a solutions architect do to redesign the application MOST cost-effectively?"
options:
  A: "Update the Auto Scaling group to use Reserved Instances instead of On-Demand Instances."
  B: "Update the Auto Scaling group to scale by launching Spot Instances instead of On-Demand Instances."
  C: "Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution to host the static web contents from an Amazon S3 bucket."
  D: "Create an AWS Lambda function behind an Amazon API Gateway API to host the static website contents."
answer: "C"
explanation: "Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers static and dynamic web content, including images, videos, CSS, and JavaScript, with low latency and high transfer speeds. It can be used to cache and distribute static content globally, reducing the load on your web servers.  By creating a CloudFront distribution and hosting static web content in an Amazon S3 bucket, you offload the serving of static content to the CDN, which can significantly reduce the load on your EC2 instances."
