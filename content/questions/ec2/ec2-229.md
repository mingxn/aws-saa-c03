question: "A company manages its own Amazon EC2 instances that run MySQL databases. The company is manually managing replication and scaling as demand increases or decreases. The company needs a new solution that simplies the process of adding or removing compute capacity to or from its database tier as needed. The solution also must offer improved performance, scaling, and durability with minimal effort from operations. Which solution fulfills these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Migrate the databases to Amazon Aurora Serverless for Aurora MySQL."
  B: "Migrate the databases to Amazon Aurora Serverless for Aurora PostgreSQL."
  C: "Combine the databases into one larger MySQL database. Run the larger database on larger EC2 instances."
  D: "Create an EC2 Auto Scaling group for the database tier. Migrate the existing databases to the new environment."
answer: "A"
explanation: "Amazon Aurora Serverless: Aurora Serverless is an on-demand, auto-scaling configuration for Amazon Aurora. It automatically adjusts the database capacity based on actual consumption, enabling seamless scaling without manual intervention. It is a fully managed service, reducing operational overhead."
