question: "A company is reviewing a recent migration of a three-tier application to a VPC. The security team discovers that the principle of least privilege is not being applied to Amazon EC2 security group ingress and egress rules between the application tiers. What should a solutions architect do to correct this issue?"
options:
  A: "Create security group rules using the instance ID as the source or destination."
  B: "Create security group rules using the security group ID as the source or destination."
  C: "Create security group rules using the VPC CIDR blocks as the source or destination."
  D: "Create security group rules using the subnet CIDR blocks as the source or destination."
answer: "B"
explanation: "Using security group IDs allows for dynamic and flexible configuration. Referencing security groups directly in rules ensures that instances associated with those security groups, regardless of their individual IDs, are included. This approach aligns with the principle of least privilege and simplifies rule management."
