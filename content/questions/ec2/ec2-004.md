question: "An application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in a VPC. The application processes logs that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The EC2 instance needs to access the S3 bucket without connectivity to the internet. Which solution will provide private network connectivity to Amazon S3?"
options:
  A: "Create a gateway VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket."
  B: "Stream the logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Export the logs to the S3 bucket."
  C: "Create an instance profile on Amazon EC2 to allow S3 access."
  D: "Create an Amazon API Gateway API with a private link to access the S3 endpoint."
answer: "A"
explanation: "Keywords: - EC2 in VPC - EC2 instance needs to access the S3 bucket without connectivity to the internet VPC endpoint allows you to connect to AWS services using a private network instead of using the public Internet.  With a gateway endpoint, you can access Amazon S3 from your VPC, without requiring an internet gateway or NAT device for your VPC, and with no additional cost. However, gateway endpoints do not allow access from on-premises networks, from peered VPCs in other AWS Regions, or through a transit gateway."
