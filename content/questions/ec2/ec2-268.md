question: "A gaming company has a web application that displays scores. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The application stores data in an Amazon RDS for MySQL database. Users are starting to experience long delays and interruptions that are caused by database read performance. The company wants to improve the user experience while minimizing changes to the application’s architecture. What should a solutions architect do to fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Use Amazon ElastiCache in front of the database."
  B: "Use RDS Proxy between the application and the database."
  C: "Migrate the application from EC2 instances to AWS Lambda."
  D: "Migrate the database from Amazon RDS for MySQL to Amazon DynamoDB."
answer: "B"
explanation: "RDS Proxy is a fully managed database proxy for Amazon RDS databases, including MySQL. It helps improve scalability and availability for database connections, reducing the impact of database connection management on the application."
