question: "A company runs a web application that is deployed on Amazon EC2 instances in the private subnet of a VPC. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) that extends across the public subnets directs web traffic to the EC2 instances. The company wants to implement new security measures to restrict inbound traffic from the ALB to the EC2 instances while preventing access from any other source inside or outside the private subnet of the EC2 instances. Which solution will fulfill these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Configure a route in a route table to direct traffic from the internet to the private IP addresses of the EC2 instances."
  B: "Configure the security group for the EC2 instances to only allow traffic that comes from the security group for the ALB."
  C: "Move the EC2 instances into the public subnet. Give the EC2 instances a set of Elastic IP addresses."
  D: "Configure the security group for the ALB to allow any TCP traffic on any port."
answer: "B"
explanation: "Security groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances. By configuring the security group for the EC2 instances to only allow traffic from the security group associated with the ALB, you can control and restrict inbound traffic effectively.  When you specify a security group as the source in the inbound rules of another security group, you allow traffic only from instances that are members of that source security group. In this case, you can allow traffic only from the ALB, ensuring that traffic is restricted to the necessary source."
