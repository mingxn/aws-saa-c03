question: "A media company hosts its website on AWS. The website application’s architecture includes a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and a database that is hosted on Amazon Aurora. The company’s cybersecurity team reports that the application is vulnerable to SQL injection. How should the company resolve this issue?"
options:
  A: "Use AWS WAF in front of the ALB. Associate the appropriate web ACLs with AWS WAF."
  B: "Create an ALB listener rule to reply to SQL injections with a xed response."
  C: "Subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced to block all SQL injection attempts automatically."
  D: "Set up Amazon Inspector to block all SQL injection attempts automatically."
answer: "A"
explanation: "AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall): AWS WAF is designed to protect web applications from common web exploits, including SQL injection. It allows you to create web access control lists (web ACLs) to define rules that filter and monitor HTTP traffic to your application.  Associating Web ACLs with AWS WAF: By using AWS WAF in front of the ALB, you can define rules to block or allow web requests based on conditions that you specify. This includes protection against SQL injection attempts. AWS WAF provides a range of conditions and rulesets that you can use to mitigate common security threats."
