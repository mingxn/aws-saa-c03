question: "A company has an application that runs on several Amazon EC2 instances. Each EC2 instance has multiple Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) data volumes attached to it. The application’s EC2 instance conguration and data need to be backed up nightly. The application also needs to be recoverable in a different AWS Region. Which solution will fulfill these requirements in the MOST operationally ecient way?"
options:
  A: "Write an AWS Lambda function that schedules nightly snapshots of the application’s EBS volumes and copies the snapshots to a different Region."
  B: "Create a backup plan by using AWS Backup to perform nightly backups. Copy the backups to another Region. Add the application’s EC2 instances as resources."
  C: "Create a backup plan by using AWS Backup to perform nightly backups. Copy the backups to another Region. Add the application’s EBS volumes as resources."
  D: "Write an AWS Lambda function that schedules nightly snapshots of the application's EBS volumes and copies the snapshots to a different Availability Zone."
answer: "C"
explanation: "AWS Backup: AWS Backup is a fully managed backup service that centralizes and automates the backup of data across AWS services. It provides a simple and efficient way to back up your EC2 instances and their associated EBS volumes. Backup Plan: With AWS Backup, you can create backup plans to define when and how your backups are performed. Backup plans allow you to schedule nightly backups and define retention policies."
