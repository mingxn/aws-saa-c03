question: "A company has Amazon EC2 instances that run nightly batch jobs to process data. The EC2 instances run in an Auto Scaling group that uses On- Demand billing. If a job fails on one instance, another instance will reprocess the job. The batch jobs run between 12:00 AM and 06:00 AM local time every day. Which solution will provide EC2 instances to fulfill these requirements MOST cost-effectively?"
options:
  A: "Purchase a 1-year Savings Plan for Amazon EC2 that covers the instance family of the Auto Scaling group that the batch job uses."
  B: "Purchase a 1-year Reserved Instance for the specific instance type and operating system of the instances in the Auto Scaling group that the batch job uses."
  C: "Create a new launch template for the Auto Scaling group. Set the instances to Spot Instances. Set a policy to scale out based on CPU usage."
  D: "Create a new launch template for the Auto Scaling group. Increase the instance size. Set a policy to scale out based on CPU usage."
