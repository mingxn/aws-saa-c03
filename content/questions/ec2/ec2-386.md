question: "An ecommerce company is running a multi-tier application on AWS. The front-end and backend tiers both run on Amazon EC2, and the database runs on Amazon RDS for MySQL. The backend tier communicates with the RDS instance. There are frequent calls to return identical datasets from the database that are causing performance slowdowns. Which action should be taken to improve the performance of the backend?"
options:
  A: "Implement Amazon SNS to store the database calls."
  B: "Implement Amazon ElastiCache to cache the large datasets."
  C: "Implement an RDS for MySQL read replica to cache database calls."
  D: "Implement Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream the calls to the database."
answer: "B"
explanation: "Amazon ElastiCache: Amazon ElastiCache is a fully managed in-memory caching service. By implementing ElastiCache, you can cache frequently accessed data in-memory, reducing the need to make repeated calls to the database. This helps improve the performance of your application by serving data directly from the cache instead of querying the database every time.  Caching Large Datasets: In scenarios where identical datasets are frequently requested, caching the results in ElastiCache can significantly reduce the load on the database and improve response times for subsequent requests. It is particularly effective for read-heavy workloads where the data does not change frequently."
