question: "A company has an application that processes customer orders. The company hosts the application on an Amazon EC2 instance that saves the orders to an Amazon Aurora database. Occasionally when traffic is high the workload does not process orders fast enough. What should a solutions architect do to write the orders reliably to the database as quickly as possible?"
options:
  A: "Increase the instance size of the EC2 instance when traffic is high. Write orders to Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). Subscribe the database endpoint to the SNS topic."
  B: "Write orders to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer to read from the SQS queue and process orders into the database."
  C: "Write orders to Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). Subscribe the database endpoint to the SNS topic. Use EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer to read from the SNS topic."
  D: "Write orders to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue when the EC2 instance reaches CPU threshold limits. Use scheduled scaling of EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer to read from the SQS queue and process orders into the database."
answer: "B"
explanation: "Amazon SQS, which is a fully managed message queuing service. Writing orders to an SQS queue allows for decoupling the EC2 instances processing the orders from the application writing the orders. EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group can then read from the SQS queue, ensuring that the processing scales with demand.  Using an Auto Scaling group ensures that you can dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on the workload. This can help handle high traffic efficiently."
