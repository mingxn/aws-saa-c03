question: "A company is implementing a new business application. The application runs on two Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon S3 bucket for document storage. A solutions architect needs to ensure that the EC2 instances can access the S3 bucket. What should the solutions architect do to fulfill this requirement?"
options:
  A: "Create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the role to the EC2 instances."
  B: "Create an IAM policy that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the policy to the EC2 instances."
  C: "Create an IAM group that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the group to the EC2 instances."
  D: "Create an IAM user that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the user account to the EC2 instances."
answer: "A"
explanation: "An IAM role is an AWS resource that allows you to delegate access to AWS resources and services. You can create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket and then attach the role to the EC2 instances. This will allow the EC2 instances to access the S3 bucket and the documents stored within it."
