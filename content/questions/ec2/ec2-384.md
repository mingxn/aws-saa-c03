question: "A company runs an application on Amazon EC2 Linux instances across multiple Availability Zones. The application needs a storage layer that is highly available and Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)-compliant. The storage layer must provide maximum data durability and must be shareable across the EC2 instances. The data in the storage layer will be accessed frequently for the first 30 days and will be accessed infrequently after that time. Which solution will fulfill these requirements MOST cost-effectively?"
options:
  A: "Use the Amazon S3 Standard storage class. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to move infrequently accessed data to S3 Glacier."
  B: "Use the Amazon S3 Standard storage class. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to move infrequently accessed data to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)."
  C: "Use the Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) Standard storage class. Create a lifecycle management policy to move infrequently accessed data to EFS Standard-Infrequent Access (EFS Standard-IA)."
  D: "Use the Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) One Zone storage class. Create a lifecycle management policy to move infrequently accessed data to EFS One Zone-Infrequent Access (EFS One Zone-IA)."
answer: "C"
explanation: "Amazon EFS provides scalable and highly available file storage in the cloud. The Standard storage class is designed for frequently accessed data, making it suitable for the initial 30 days of frequent access.  You can create a lifecycle management policy for EFS that automatically transitions infrequently accessed files to the EFS Standard-Infrequent Access (EFS Standard-IA) storage class. This helps optimize costs by moving less frequently accessed data to a lower-cost storage tier."
