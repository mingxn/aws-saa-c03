question: "A company has a three-tier application for image sharing. The application uses an Amazon EC2 instance for the front-end layer, another EC2 instance for the application layer, and a third EC2 instance for a MySQL database. A solutions architect must design a scalable and highly available solution that requires the least amount of change to the application. Which solution fulfills these requirements?"
options:
  A: "Use Amazon S3 to host the front-end layer. Use AWS Lambda functions for the application layer. Move the database to an Amazon DynamoDB table. Use Amazon S3 to store and serve users’ images."
  B: "Use load-balanced Multi-AZ AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments for the front-end layer and the application layer. Move the database to an Amazon RDS DB instance with multiple read replicas to serve users’ images."
  C: "Use Amazon S3 to host the front-end layer. Use a fleet of EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group for the application layer. Move the database to a memory optimized instance type to store and serve users’ images."
  D: "Use load-balanced Multi-AZ AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments for the front-end layer and the application layer. Move the database to an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance. Use Amazon S3 to store and serve users’ images."
answer: "D"
explanation: "AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides an easy way to deploy and manage applications. By using Multi-AZ environments, the front-end and application layers can automatically scale and provide high availability across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB Instance: Moving the database to an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance ensures high availability and automatic failover in the event of a failure in one Availability Zone. Amazon S3 for Storing and Serving Images: Using Amazon S3 for storing and serving users' images is a scalable and cost-effective solution. S3 is designed for high durability and availability, making it suitable for serving static content like images."
