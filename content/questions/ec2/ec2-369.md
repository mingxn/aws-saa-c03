difficulty: "medium"
question: "A company has migrated an application to Amazon EC2 Linux instances. One of these EC2 instances runs several 1-hour tasks on a schedule. These tasks were written by different teams and have no common programming language. The company is concerned about performance and scalability while these tasks run on a single instance. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to resolve these concerns. Which solution will fulfill these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?"
options:
  A: "Use AWS Batch to run the tasks as jobs. Schedule the jobs by using Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)."
  B: "Convert the EC2 instance to a container. Use AWS App Runner to create the container on demand to run the tasks as jobs."
  C: "Copy the tasks into AWS Lambda functions. Schedule the Lambda functions by using Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)."
  D: "Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) of the EC2 instance that runs the tasks. Create an Auto Scaling group with the AMI to run multiple copies of the instance."
answer: "A"
explanation: "AWS Batch: AWS Batch is a fully managed service for running batch computing workloads. It dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources based on the volume and specific resource requirements of the batch jobs. It allows you to run tasks written in different programming languages with minimal operational overhead."
