question: "A company needs to create an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster to host a digital media streaming application. The EKS cluster will use a managed node group that is backed by Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes for storage. The company must encrypt all data at rest by using a customer managed key that is stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Which combination of actions will fulfill this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead? (Choose two.)"
options:
  A: "Use a Kubernetes plugin that uses the customer managed key to perform data encryption."
  B: "After creation of the EKS cluster, locate the EBS volumes. Enable encryption by using the customer managed key."
  C: "Enable EBS encryption by default in the AWS Region where the EKS cluster will be created. Select the customer managed key as the default key."
  D: "Create the EKS cluster. Create an IAM role that has a policy that grants permission to the customer managed key. Associate the role with the EKS cluster. E. Store the customer managed key as a Kubernetes secret in the EKS cluster. Use the customer managed key to encrypt the EBS volumes."
answer: "C"
explanation: "D. Create the EKS cluster. Create an IAM role that has a policy that grants permission to the customer managed key. Associate the role with the EKS cluster.  EBS encryption is set regionally. AWS account is global but it does not mean EBS encryption is enable by default at account level. default EBS encryption is a regional setting within your AWS account. Enabling it in a specific region ensures that all new EBS volumes created in that region are encrypted by default, using either the default AWS managed key or a customer managed key that you specify."
