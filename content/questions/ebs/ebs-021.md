question: "An ecommerce company wants to launch a one-deal-a-day website on AWS. Each day will feature exactly one product on sale for a period of 24 hours. The company wants to be able to handle millions of requests each hour with millisecond latency during peak hours. Which solution will fulfill these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?"
options:
  A: "Use Amazon S3 to host the full website in different S3 buckets. Add Amazon CloudFront distributions. Set the S3 buckets as origins for the distributions. Store the order data in Amazon S3."
  B: "Deploy the full website on Amazon EC2 instances that run in Auto Scaling groups across multiple Availability Zones. Add an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute the website traffic. Add another ALB for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon RDS for MySQL."
  C: "Migrate the full application to run in containers. Host the containers on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Use the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler to increase and decrease the number of pods to process bursts in traffic. Store the data in Amazon RDS for MySQL."
  D: "Use an Amazon S3 bucket to host the website's static content. Deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Set the S3 bucket as the origin. Use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon DynamoDB."
answer: "D"
explanation: "Use an Amazon S3 bucket to host the website's static content, deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution, set the S3 bucket as the origin, and use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.  Using Amazon S3 to host static content and Amazon CloudFront to distribute the content can provide high performance and scale for websites with millions of requests each hour. Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda can be used to build scalable and highly available backend APIs to support the website, and Amazon DynamoDB can be used to store the data. This solution requires minimal operational overhead as it leverages fully managed services that automatically scale to fulfill demand."
