question: "A company’s security team requests that network traffic be captured in VPC Flow Logs. The logs will be frequently accessed for 90 days and then accessed intermittently. What should a solutions architect do to fulfill these requirements when conguring the logs?"
options:
  A: "Use Amazon CloudWatch as the target. Set the CloudWatch log group with an expiration of 90 days"
  B: "Use Amazon Kinesis as the target. Configure the Kinesis stream to always retain the logs for 90 days."
  C: "Use AWS CloudTrail as the target. Configure CloudTrail to save to an Amazon S3 bucket, and enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering."
  D: "Use Amazon S3 as the target. Enable an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the logs to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 90 days."
answer: "D"
explanation: "Amazon S3 is a scalable and cost-effective object storage service. Enabling an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition logs to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 90 days is a suitable solution. This approach allows you to store the logs in a cost-effective manner, automatically moving them to a lower-cost storage class after the initial 90 days."
