question: "A company has two VPCs named Management and Production. The Management VPC uses VPNs through a customer gateway to connect to a single device in the data center. The Production VPC uses a virtual private gateway with two attached AWS Direct Connect connections. The Management and Production VPCs both use a single VPC peering connection to allow communication between the applications. What should a solutions architect do to mitigate any single point of failure in this architecture?"
options:
  A: "Add a set of VPNs between the Management and Production VPCs."
  B: "Add a second virtual private gateway and attach it to the Management VPC."
  C: "Add a second set of VPNs to the Management VPC from a second customer gateway device."
  D: "Add a second VPC peering connection between the Management VPC and the Production VPC."
answer: "C"
explanation: "Adding a second set of VPN connections from the Management VPC to a second customer gateway device provides redundancy and eliminates this single point of failure."
