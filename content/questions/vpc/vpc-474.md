question: "A company has multiple VPCs across AWS Regions to support and run workloads that are isolated from workloads in other Regions. Because of a recent application launch requirement, the company’s VPCs must communicate with all other VPCs across all Regions. Which solution will fulfill these requirements with the LEAST amount of administrative effort?"
options:
  A: "Use VPC peering to manage VPC communication in a single Region. Use VPC peering across Regions to manage VPC communications."
  B: "Use AWS Direct Connect gateways across all Regions to connect VPCs across regions and manage VPC communications."
  C: "Use AWS Transit Gateway to manage VPC communication in a single Region and Transit Gateway peering across Regions to manage VPC communications."
  D: "Use AWS PrivateLink across all Regions to connect VPCs across Regions and manage VPC communications"
answer: "C"
explanation: "AWS Transit Gateway is designed for simplifying the connectivity between multiple VPCs and on-premises networks. It allows for hub-and-spoke connectivity patterns, making it easier to manage communication across multiple VPCs. By using AWS Transit Gateway in a single Region to connect VPCs and enabling Transit Gateway peering across Regions, you can efficiently manage communication between VPCs in different Regions with centralized control and minimal administrative effort."
